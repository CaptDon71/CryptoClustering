# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge - Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
Summary
This project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency market data. The goal is to determine if cryptocurrencies can be grouped based on their 24-hour and 7-day price changes. Using clustering algorithms like K-Means and dimensionality reduction via PCA, the analysis identifies patterns and trends in the dataset.

Files
Crypto_Clustering.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
Resources/crypto_market_data.csv: The dataset used for the analysis, containing cryptocurrency price data and other market-related features.
Objectives
Perform data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
Apply K-Means clustering to group cryptocurrencies based on price changes.
Use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dataset's dimensionality and compare the clustering results with and without PCA.
Evaluate the effectiveness of clustering in identifying trends.
Technologies
Python
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
Matplotlib and Plotly for data visualization
Results
The project demonstrates the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering results and provides insights into how short-term price changes influence cryptocurrency groupings.
